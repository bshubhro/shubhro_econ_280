# README for Part 1: Understanding Replication

## Overview

This project is part of an assignment focused on understanding the principles of data replication in research. The goal is to familiarize graduate students with the components of a properly documented replication package and to establish a structured project directory.

## Project Structure

This repository contains an empty project with the following directory structure:

### Directory Descriptions

- **01_data/**: This folder will contain all relevant data files used in the analysis.
- **02_code/**: This folder will house all scripts and code necessary for data analysis and replication.
- **03_output/**: This folder is for storing all the necessary tables and figures which will be used in the draft.

## References

The folder structure closely follow the [AEA Data Editor Guidance](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/preparing-for-data-deposit.html).
