# README for Part 1: Understanding Replication

## Overview

This project is part of an assignment focused on understanding the principles of data replication in research. The goal is to familiarize graduate students with the components of a properly documented replication package and to establish a structured project directory.

## Project Structure

This repository contains an empty project with the following directory structure:

### Directory Descriptions

- **01_data/**: This folder will contain all relevant data files used in the analysis.
- **02_code/**: This folder will house all scripts and code necessary for data analysis and replication.
- **03_output/**: This folder is for storing all the necessary tables and figures which will be used in the draft.

## References

The folder structure closely follow the [AEA Data Editor Guidance](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/preparing-for-data-deposit.html).

## Paper Summary

This paper examines the impact of limited access to formal savings services on business growth in developing countries. The authors conduct a field experiment in rural Kenya, providing randomly selected market vendors and bicycle taxi drivers with access to no-interest bank accounts. The study finds that a substantial share of market vendors, who are primarily women, utilised the accounts, leading to increased savings, productive investments, and private expenditures. In contrast, the provision of bank accounts did not impact bicycle taxi drivers, suggesting that the intervention was particularly effective in addressing savings barriers faced by women in this context.

To assess the impact of providing access to savings accounts, the authors utilise a randomised controlled trial design. Their sample consists of 250 individuals in Bumala Town, Kenya, primarily composed of market vendors (mostly women) and bicycle taxi drivers (exclusively men). Data is collected from two primary sources: administrative bank records on account usage, and detailed daily logbooks maintained by participants. These logbooks contain information on savings behaviour, business investments, and expenditures. The authors focus their analysis on market women due to data quality issues and attrition observed in the sample of bicycle taxi drivers. 

## Data Summary
The dataset in this study is structured around **individual microenterprise owners** as the **unit of observation**. This includes **250 individuals** from Bumala Town in rural Kenya. Participants are mainly composed of **market vendors, predominantly women, and male bicycle taxi drivers**. Data collection involved **administrative bank records detailing account usage, as well as daily logbooks** maintained by participants documenting **savings, business investments and expenditures**.  However, due to data quality concerns and attrition within the bicycle taxi driver group, the primary analysis focuses on the **170 market women with complete logbook data**.
